# kwic "Industrial Controls" for wxWidgets from [KOAN Software](https://koansoftware.com)
This is ancient (~2007) and no longer supported.
This repository has a version running under wxWidgets 3.2 and Visual Studio 2022.
I resurrected it hoping it would help with a project but the graphics are pretty rudimentary.
Hope it helps someone!
